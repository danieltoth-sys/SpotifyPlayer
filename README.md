# SpotifyPlayer
Basic Music Player. Uses Spotify API.
Connects to your Spotify, and you can play songs from you playlists.
You will be able to play Local songs from this app too. 
Custom background, custom light/dark, custom color theme.

Still in development! Used many tutorials for the Spotify API, because yes, I am dumb.
Downloadable stuff will be added in the Release tab. For your own safety, please do not download this crap while it's in development.

Open for any interesting ideas.
